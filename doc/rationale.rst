PyKNyX: A KNX stack for Python
==============================

Author: Matthias Urlichs <matthias@urlichs.de>

Rationale
=========

The KNX router I maintain (`knxd`_) is written in C++. It auto-generates
code to access its features, including something that looks like Python but
really isn't. Thus, alternate solutions were sought.

`pKNyX`_ looked like a good fit at first. Unfortunately I need features
(like multiple device nodes which can talk to each other) which didn't work
in that code base. After extensive rewriting, its author requested that I
publish my code under a different name. Thus, `PyKNyX`_. 

The name is pronounced somewhat like "picnic", mainly because writing KNX
code properly is not.

In addition, some aspects of `pKNyX`_ didn't work for me and shouted
"Rewrite me!". I couldn't ignore that temptation.

Changes to pKNyX
================

The following sub-chapters describe the changes I implemented.

Using more than one device
--------------------------

Running an entirely separate KNX protocol stack per device does not scale.

Aassume that you want to monitor a building with 1000 devices. That will
open 2000 sockets and create 5000 OS-level threads, half of which will wake
up for each packet, only to decide that it's not for them.

Thus, the "master" object in PyKNyX is no longer a device, but the ETS router.
This is no longer a singleton, allowing you to run more than one ETS stack
in a single program (if desired). The ETS router will forward incoming
packets to all (other) devices.

TODO: propagate group membership to ETS, in order to reduce overhead.

Using more than one transport
-----------------------------

It may make sense to use more than one transport. For instance, if you have
a hardware KNX interface which doesn't speak multicast, you may want to
connect to it without running knxd.

Also, it may make sense for different PyKNyX programs to talk to each other,
e.g. for testing, without transmitting multicast messages.

For this reason, the notion of a "Transport" does no longer exist in PyKNyX.
Instead, Layer-2 drivers and KNX objects are treated the same. The ETS
router contains a dispatcher which simply copies each packet to all other
interfaces which want it. (Of course it decrements the hop count when
forwarding from one bus to another.)

This means that the meanings of data "indication" and "request", as used by
the OSI layering, seem reversed when you examine external interfaces.
A Request is now something that is destined for the ETS router while an
Indication is a data packet that has been distributed by ETS: from the
point-of-view of PyKNyX, the ETS router is the lowest layer.

Assigning physical addresses
----------------------------

Usually you don't really care about a device's physical address, as long as
it is routed correctly and it isn't used by anything else on the bus. 

Thus, ETS will assign physical addresses dynamically. At init time you can
specify how many free addresses there are and where the free-address rnge
begins. If your program registers more devices than that, an error is
triggered.

The default is to share the ETS router's address with the first device that
gets registered. This obviously only works when you only have one device.

Split off tests
---------------

Originally, tests were based on unittest and included in the main code.
A module was tested by simply running it.

I decided to move all tests into a "tests" directory.

* Use `pytest` instead of unittest (much nicer)
* Ability to test installed or other versions of PyKNyX
* More easily runnable by ``setup.py``

Minor fixes
-----------

* Python 3 support
* merged GrOAT listings
* added integration tests
* multicast socket

Hop count
+++++++++

Experience shows that the KNX protocol's strange idea to have a hop count
of 7 that's never decremented is a bad idea. pnkyx always decrements the
hop counter.

API Changes in the knxd version 
===============================

ETS
+++

The address and low-level driver arguments of class Device have been moved
to the ETS object. Also, ETS object is no longer a singleton. Thus, this code

	dev = MyDevice("1.2.3")
	ETS().register(dev)
	ETS().weave(dev) # aliases: bind(), link()
	dev.mainLoop()

needs to be replaced with

	ets = ETS("1.2.3")
	dev = MyDevice(ets)
	ets.mainLoop()

The method ``ETS.weave()`` has been removed.

``ETS.printGroat()`` used to require a device argument. This is now
optional; if not used, the returned table will contain all devices.

Planned changes ("TODO")
========================

* more tests, esp. end-to-end of the example code snippets

* Requiring a separate class per device isn't very Python-ish

* … and doesn't lend itself to generating multiple devices from a config file

* more code cleanups

* declare datapoints etc. as objects, not dicts

* propagate group address filtering down the stack

* (adding a dispatch table instead of looping through all the data layers)

* route datagrams to, and add caching of, individual addresses

* add using a socket to knxd or a tunnel

* possibly port more features of knxd

* possibly² add code for handling large knx networks, e.g. group address filtering and translation
